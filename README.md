<p> There is a game where the gate opens at level 30 and gives many privileges to players. The game company wants to change the level 30 to level 40 for that gate. The game company wants to test if the change in gate position would affect the retentivity of players or not. As it is very important for a game company to earn money by improving players retentivity<p>
    
<p>The retentin is measured over 14 days of installation of game<p>
<p>There are 2 retentivity days, 1 day, 7-days<p>
<p>Since the data is less, we need to resample the data<p>
<p>Understand the retentivity by plotting the distributin foor 1 day retention for both versins f the game and we find the difference if present, Similarly, we can analyse this fr  7 day retention<p>
<p>The 7-day retentivity helps analyse the gate position,as after a week many players can reach the level of the gate.! day retentivity analysis does not give much idea about it. The afetr 7 days, the difference in retentivity  for both versiuons A-B of game can help us to decide whether we should position the gate at level 30 or at 40 level<p>
    
<p>This is a *statistical analysis* over A-B test<p>
